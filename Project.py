#In this python project, you input a year and check whether it is a leap year or not. For this,
#youâ€™ll have to create a function that recognizes the pattern of leap years and can try fitting the
#inputted year into the pattern. In the end, you can print the result using a boolean expression




#Number_guessing > Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10,
#1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses
#wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible,
#greater or smaller, or a combination of all
